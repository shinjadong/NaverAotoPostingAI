class SequenceMatcher:
    """\n    SequenceMatcher is a flexible class for comparing pairs of sequences of\n    any type, so long as the sequence elements are hashable.  The basic\n    algorithm predates, and is a little fancier than, an algorithm\n    published in the late 1980\'s by Ratcliff and Obershelp under the\n    hyperbolic name \"gestalt pattern matching\".  The basic idea is to find\n    the longest contiguous matching subsequence that contains no \"junk\"\n    elements (R-O doesn\'t address junk).  The same idea is then applied\n    recursively to the pieces of the sequences to the left and to the right\n    of the matching subsequence.  This does not yield minimal edit\n    sequences, but does tend to yield matches that \"look right\" to people.\n\n    SequenceMatcher tries to compute a \"human-friendly diff\" between two\n    sequences.  Unlike e.g. UNIX(tm) diff, the fundamental notion is the\n    longest *contiguous* & junk-free matching subsequence.  That\'s what\n    catches peoples\' eyes.  The Windows(tm) windiff has another interesting\n    notion, pairing up elements that appear uniquely in each sequence.\n    That, and the method here, appear to yield more intuitive difference\n    reports than does diff.  This method appears to be the least vulnerable\n    to syncing up on blocks of \"junk lines\", though (like blank lines in\n    ordinary text files, or maybe \"<P>\" lines in HTML files).  That may be\n    because this is the only method of the 3 that has a *concept* of\n    \"junk\" <wink>.\n\n    Example, comparing two strings, and considering blanks to be \"junk\":\n\n    >>> s = SequenceMatcher(lambda x: x == \" \",\n    ...                     \"private Thread currentThread;\",\n    ...                     \"private volatile Thread currentThread;\")\n    >>>\n\n    .ratio() returns a float in [0, 1], measuring the \"similarity\" of the\n    sequences.  As a rule of thumb, a .ratio() value over 0.6 means the\n    sequences are close matches:\n\n    >>> print(round(s.ratio(), 3))\n    0.866\n    >>>\n\n    If you\'re only interested in where the sequences match,\n    .get_matching_blocks() is handy:\n\n    >>> for block in s.get_matching_blocks():\n    ...     print(\"a[%d] and b[%d] match for %d elements\" % block)\n    a[0] and b[0] match for 8 elements\n    a[8] and b[17] match for 21 elements\n    a[29] and b[38] match for 0 elements\n\n    Note that the last tuple returned by .get_matching_blocks() is always a\n    dummy, (len(a), len(b), 0), and this is the only case in which the last\n    tuple element (number of elements matched) is 0.\n\n    If you want to know how to change the first sequence into the second,\n    use .get_opcodes():\n\n    >>> for opcode in s.get_opcodes():\n    ...     print(\"%6s a[%d:%d] b[%d:%d]\" % opcode)\n     equal a[0:8] b[0:8]\n    insert a[8:8] b[8:17]\n     equal a[8:29] b[17:38]\n\n    See the Differ class for a fancy human-friendly file differencer, which\n    uses SequenceMatcher both to compare sequences of lines, and to compare\n    sequences of characters within similar (near-matching) lines.\n\n    See also function get_close_matches() in this module, which shows how\n    simple code building on SequenceMatcher can be used to do useful work.\n\n    Timing:  Basic R-O is cubic time worst case and quadratic time expected\n    case.  SequenceMatcher is quadratic time for the worst case and has\n    expected-case behavior dependent in a complicated way on how many\n    elements the sequences have in common; best case time is linear.\n    """

Differ uses\n    SequenceMatcher both to compare sequences of lines, and to compare\n    sequences of characters within similar (near-matching) lines.\n\n    Each line of a Differ delta begins with a two-letter code:\n\n        \'- \'    line unique to sequence 1\n        \'+ \'    line unique to sequence 2\n        \'  \'    line common to both sequences\n        \'? \'    line not present in either input sequence\n\n    Lines beginning with \'? \' attempt to guide the eye to intraline\n    differences, and were not present in either input sequence.  These lines\n    can be confusing if the sequences contain tab characters.\n\n    Note that Differ makes no claim to produce a *minimal* diff.  To the\n    contrary, minimal diffs are often counter-intuitive, because they synch\n    up anywhere possible, sometimes accidental matches 100 pages apart.\n    Restricting synch points to contiguous matches preserves some notion of\n    locality, at the occasional cost of producing a longer diff.\n\n    Example: Comparing two texts.\n\n    First we set up the texts, sequences of individual single-line strings\n    ending with newlines (such sequences can also be obtained from the\n    `readlines()` method of file-like objects):\n\n    >>> text1 = \'\'\'  1.
